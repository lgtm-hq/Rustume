## Commit Summary (Conventional Commits)

- Title (required, present tense):

  ```text
  <type>(optional-scope)!: concise summary
  ```

  Examples: `feat(cli): add --group-by`, `fix(parser): handle empty config`,
  `refactor(core)!: rewrite engine`

- Type:
  - [ ] feat (minor)
  - [ ] fix / perf (patch)
  - [ ] docs
  - [ ] refactor
  - [ ] test
  - [ ] chore / ci / style

- Breaking change:
  - [ ] `!` in title or `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer included

### Release Trigger Rules (exact)

- A merged PR will bump the version based on its title (squash merge required):
  - `feat(...)` or `feat:` → MINOR bump
  - `fix(...)` / `fix:` or `perf(...)` / `perf:` → PATCH bump
  - Any title with `!` after the type (e.g. `feat!:` or `feat(scope)!:`) or a body
    containing `BREAKING CHANGE:` → MAJOR bump
- Use squash merge so the PR title becomes the merge commit title.
